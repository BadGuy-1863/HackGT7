You're feeling hungry, so you decide to grab some food from your favorite restaurant. However, there's two locations within walking distance of your house, and you don't know which location to go to. It can be quite difficult to decide which location of a restaurant patronize. It would be best to go to the location with the shortest wait time, but it's difficult to guess which location will have you waiting the least! The time of customers is valuable not only to the customers themselves but also the merchants, who want their customer experience to be as effortless and straightforward as possible. With access to wait times, merchants and customers will benefit from the load management of each location.

The website was built with SCSS, Typescript, and React. In addition, we used the Google Maps API to assist with processing location data, hosted a database with individual store information on Azure, harnessed an NCR API (namely the Business Services Platform) to obtain information from restaurants locations and update the database, and utilized Flask and Python to call the API and update the database.
